# Breast Cancer Detection System

A Machine Learning project to detect and classify breast cancer tumors as **Benign** or **Malignant** using clinical data.

## 🟢 Project Description
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based classification system for early detection of breast cancer.

**Duration:** January 2025 – March 2025

**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

- Developed a machine learning-based classification system for early detection of breast cancer using clinical data.
- Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine algorithms for accurate tumor type prediction, achieving 97% accuracy.
- Created an efficient data processing pipeline to clean, preprocess, and transform raw data for model training.
- Applied data preprocessing, feature scaling, and visualization techniques to analyze tumor characteristics and improve model performance.
